# Community Color Palettes
This is the online source for Community Color Palettes!

If you want to create a color palette, download a copy of `ComColPalIconTemplate.rbxlx`. Also do the following:
* Do not change any `Lighting` attributes or add any `Instance`s to it.
* Render quality should be at its lowest.
* Set the color of each `Part` to the name of it (e.g. red, yellow).
    * The Top bricks should be more saturated, whereas the other bricks should be darker (e.g. maroon).
    * If for any reason your color palette doesn't have a main color (which may not give you the best chance of approval), then set all bricks to the nearest color you can find. (e.g. red could be brown, blue could be seafoam green, etc.)
* Resize the window so that the `ViewportSize` of the `Camera` has an aspect ratio of 1:1, and is 640x or higher.

When the viewport has been captured, you can now add the logo of where you got the color palettes from. Make sure that your logo:
* isn't stretched or low quality.
* is the right one. <small><small>Why did we even have to write this?</small></small>
* does not violate Roblox's terms of service.
